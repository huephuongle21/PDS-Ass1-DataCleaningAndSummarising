# Data Cleaning and Summarising

Examine a data file and carry out the first steps of the data science project, including the cleaning and exploring of data. The data set is provided by Basketball-Conference.com, which contains stats of 492 NBA players during 2020-2021 season (a few players appeared more than once since they played for different teams in the same season).

# Process and Methods

- The data set file is loaded and cleaned. After dealing with all the potential issues/errors in the data appropriately, the cleaned data is written to the file named '**cleaned NBA players stats.csv**'.

- Data is explored based on the following steps:
  - Explore the player's total points by analyzing the composition of the total points of the top five players.
  - Explore the error in columns 3P, 3PA, 3P% by visualization.
  - Analyze the relationship between the player's total points and three other features.

# Installation and Running

- Clone this repo to your computer.

- Ensure the data set file is in the same directory with the assignment1.jpynb file.

- Open the assignment1.jpynb file in Jupyter Notebook with Ananconda3.

- Select "Restart & Run All".
